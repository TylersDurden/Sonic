They say the best way to get better with a computer language is to solve 
a problem with it. Well I want to get better at utilizing the powerful
os python library that allows you to execute shell scripting from within
a python program. 

I really like music, so I figured trying to create a program that will 
utilize the internet to pull some static music files I like and create a 
little on the fly music player program.

This is the command line interface (CLI) based way of interacting with 
the program. As of now it supports a pretty shitty shuffle method, and
then a method for selecting songs to listen to from the available songs.
